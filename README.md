# Image Segmenter

An implementation of a graph-based image segmentation algorithm, adapted from Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher's 
[Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation][1]. The algorithm attemps to to partition a given scene into a set of
similar regions, with the purpose of extracting semantic information from the raw image data.
